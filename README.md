# joshka/homebrew-audio
Homebrew Casks for Audio Plugins such as VST, VST2, AU, AAX. This was to scratch an itch that wasn't being served by the core repos. It's highly likely that these will get out of date. Feel free to fork this repo and submit a PR with new software or an update. Someday I plan to get a bunch of those freeware plugins listed in here.

## Usage
After you [install homebrew](https://brew.sh/), tap this repo:
```shell
$ brew tap joshka/audio
```
You can now install casks from this repo.
```shell
$ brew cask install d16-frontier
```
